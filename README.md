# when-will-we-next-see-this-warm-place
when will we next see this warm place offers glimpses into shared personal memories found between two sisters of their home in western Sydney. The piece materialises in the form of an premature interactive website, constructed collaboratively by the two.  The background, animations, game character and supporting text, references to the popular arcade game, Midnight Maxitune, and to lad youth subculture from the south-west. The work is informed by conversations on language as sources of identity, and how memories of upbringing in a place forms an unbreakable tether. They lay bare the feelings that arise when these connections are threatened, and ruminate on the future of a familiar home, which lays unclear in the wake of gentrification.
